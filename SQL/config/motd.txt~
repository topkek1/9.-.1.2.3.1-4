<small><small><u>Disclaimer</u><br>
We are a seperate branch from Apophis' Colonial Marines and believe in entirely different philosphy and management protocol.<br>
SS13 is an open-source creation, there is no stupid policy or license you will enforce nor will you scare us with legal mumbo-jumbo, if you have an issue, we will gladly give you an address to come and do something about it!

P.S.A: We are now switched over to our dedicated linux server... Enjoy!
